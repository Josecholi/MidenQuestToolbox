# Miden Quest Tier Chance Finder
Takes the resources you find and guesses as to the T% chance of a tile.

# To Use:
Take the following code and copy it into a bookmarklet.

    javascript:%20(function(){%20var%20script%20=%20document.createElement("script");%20script.src%20=%20"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaalah/MidenQuestTierChanceFinder/master/app.js";%20document.body.appendChild(script);})();
    
Click the bookmarklet while on the resource gathering page. Navigating away from this page will break the script.

Let it run for several hundred cycles to get a better picture of the potential T%.
